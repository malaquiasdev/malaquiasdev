### Hi dear friend <a href="https://malaquias.dev/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a>

I'm a back-end developer with 7+ years of of experience in developing enterprise applications from Brazil, currently working to [Greenlight](https://greenlight.com).

I'm working mostly with AWS, terraform, kubernetes and containers with node.js and typeScript!

As a developer I‚Äôm in a constant search for best practices and also willing to try new technologies, programming languages, and tools.
